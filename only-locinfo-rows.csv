22,Kingsburg Police Department ,Fresno,01/09/2017 - 14:14,"On 04/04/2016 at 0923 hours, Brian Price contacted Officer Eric Vasquez of the Kingsburg Police Department, to report his identity had been compromised by an unknown person trying to obtain an Amazon.Com Visa Signature Card under his contact information. Price also told Vasquez he received notification by several Fresno and Clovis businesses, that attempts to purchase goods through mail order credit lines had also been discovered using Pricesâ€™ contact information. Price told Vasquez that he had never used the assumed names given under each transaction, and had not incurred any physical liability that he knew of, but took immediate measures to notify credit bureaus that his identity had been compromised. 

I received the case on 12/01/2016, and began investigating the matter further. I was able to make contact with Jake De La Cerda, who worked for the Fraud Application Department of JP Morgan Chase & Co. (Bank that sponsors Amazon.Com Visa Card Lines of Credit), who provided me with information about a possible suspect(s) who initiated the line of credit utilizing Priceâ€™s personal information. De La Cerda provided me with the date, time, credit card application reference number, email address, and technology based IP address of where the transaction was completed. De La Cerda emailed me a copy of the information, which I used to locate the internet provider information. 

I learned Comcast Cable Communications Inc. was the internet provider and owner/operator for IP address 50.143.226.197, used on the dates and times (03/17/2016 at 18:26 EST) the suspect(s) tried to obtain the line of credit. I obtained Comcastâ€™s information through a web based company that specializes in gathering IP registration information. I used the information to contact Comcast Security Breach Operations Member, Tom Stevens who informed me he would be able to assist me with the information I was seeking from the IP address, after I provided him with a validated search warrant. Stevens also informed me that the information would take approximately 30 days to gather. 


Your Affiant subsequently initiated a search in the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) and revealed the IP address 50.143.226.197 is owned by internet service provider, Comcast Cable Communications Inc.  Your Affiant believes that Comcast Cable Inc.  will have subscriber information pertaining to the identity of the suspect(s) who used IP address; 50.143.226.197, utilized on 03/17/2016 at 18:26 EST to try and obtain a line of credit using the victims personal identifying information and have the mailed to the victims house, located on 1350 Kamm Ave. Kingsburg, CA 93631.

Based on my training and experience, I believe the requested information is being held by all carriers listed in Attachment B. This information is relevant to an investigation concerning the offense of identity theft. 

Your Affiant has reasonable cause to believe that grounds for the issuance of a search warrant exist, as set forth in Section 1524 of the Penal Code of the State of California, based upon the aforementioned information, facts and circumstances.  Furthermore, based on my experience with wireless communication companies, information related to accounts and electronic communications may take some time to retrieve.  Because of this, it is requested that a 30-day extension on the search warrant return be authorized.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, based upon the showing in the Statement of Probable Cause / Affidavit by your Affiant (David Pugliese), that it reasonably appears necessary to extend the time for Return to Search Warrant for 30 days to January 22, 2017.
